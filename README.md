## A Simple Example

Installation using a Python package manager:
```
pip install BizAPI
```

````python
from bizapi import BizAPI
from bizapi.types import Request, Response

app = BizAPI()


@app.route('/')
def home(request: Request, response: Response):
    response.text = 'This is the home page'

````
````shell
gunicorn main:app
````

---

## Function-Based Routing
```python
from bizapi import BizAPI
from bizapi.types import Request, Response

app = BizAPI()


@app.route('/')
def index(request: Request, response: Response):
    response.text = "Hello World!"
```

## Parameterized Routing
```python
@app.route('/say-hello/{name}')
def sayhello(request: Request, response: Response, name: str):
    response.text = f"Assalawma Ã¡leykum {name}"
```

## Allowed Methods
```python
@app.route('/article', methods=['POST'])
def create_article(request: Request, response: Response):
    # Create a new article
    pass


@app.route('/article', methods=['GET'])
def get_article(request: Request, response: Response):
    # Get an article
    pass
```
```python
@app.post('/article')
def create_product(request: Request, response: Response):
    # Create a new article
    pass


@app.get('/article')
def get_product(request: Request, response: Response):
    # Get an article
    pass
```

## Class-Based Routing
```python
@app.route('/article')
class Article:
    def get(request: Request, response: Response):
        # Get an article
        pass
    
    def post(request: Request, response: Response):
        # Create a new article
        pass
```
